List what this task must not change.

## File Boundaries

### Must Not Modify

- Shared schemas, migrations, auth, payment, or build configuration unless explicitly listed above.

## Context To Read

- `.ai-team/memory/project-brief.md`

## Implementation Notes

- Keep the change small enough for one reviewer to inspect quickly.
- Prefer existing project patterns over new abstractions.
- If boundaries are wrong, stop and update this card before editing.
- Create or use a task branch when code changes are required.
- Keep GitHub issue/PR fields updated when GitHub is used for the project.
- Record execution or review evidence in `.ai-team/state/runs.json`.
